<P>Configuration for Load Balancing Virtual Server resource.</P><p class="heading">Read/write properties</p><p class="property_name">name<span class="property_type">&lt;String&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">Name for the virtual server. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at sign (@), equal sign (=), and hyphen (-) characters. Can be changed after the virtual server is created.<br/><br/>CLI Users: If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, &quot;my vserver&quot; or &#39;my vserver&#39;). .<br/>Minimum length =  1</p><p class="property_name">servicetype<span class="property_type">&lt;String&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">Protocol used by the service (also called the service type).<br/>Possible values = HTTP, FTP, TCP, UDP, SSL, SSL_BRIDGE, SSL_TCP, DTLS, NNTP, DNS, DHCPRA, ANY, SIP_UDP, SIP_TCP, SIP_SSL, DNS_TCP, RTSP, PUSH, SSL_PUSH, RADIUS, RDP, MYSQL, MSSQL, DIAMETER, SSL_DIAMETER, TFTP, ORACLE, SMPP, SYSLOGTCP, SYSLOGUDP, FIX, SSL_FIX</p><p class="property_name">ipv46<span class="property_type">&lt;String&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">IPv4 or IPv6 address to assign to the virtual server.</p><p class="property_name">ippattern<span class="property_type">&lt;String&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">IP address pattern, in dotted decimal notation, for identifying packets to be accepted by the virtual server. The IP Mask parameter specifies which part of the destination IP address is matched against the pattern.  Mutually exclusive with the IP Address parameter. <br/>For example, if the IP pattern assigned to the virtual server is 198.51.100.0 and the IP mask is 255.255.240.0 (a forward mask), the first 20 bits in the destination IP addresses are matched with the first 20 bits in the pattern. The virtual server accepts requests with IP addresses that range from 198.51.96.1 to 198.51.111.254.  You can also use a pattern such as 0.0.2.2 and a mask such as 0.0.255.255 (a reverse mask).<br/>If a destination IP address matches more than one IP pattern, the pattern with the longest match is selected, and the associated virtual server processes the request. For example, if virtual servers vs1 and vs2 have the same IP pattern, 0.0.100.128, but different IP masks of 0.0.255.255 and 0.0.224.255, a destination IP address of 198.51.100.128 has the longest match with the IP pattern of vs1. If a destination IP address matches two or more virtual servers to the same extent, the request is processed by the virtual server whose port number matches the port number in the request.</p><p class="property_name">ipmask<span class="property_type">&lt;String&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">IP mask, in dotted decimal notation, for the IP Pattern parameter. Can have leading or trailing non-zero octets (for example, 255.255.240.0 or 0.0.255.255). Accordingly, the mask specifies whether the first n bits or the last n bits of the destination IP address in a client request are to be matched with the corresponding bits in the IP pattern. The former is called a forward mask. The latter is called a reverse mask.</p><p class="property_name">port<span class="property_type">&lt;Integer&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">Port number for the virtual server.<br/>Range 1 - 65535<br/>* in CLI is represented as 65535 in NITRO API</p><p class="property_name">range<span class="property_type">&lt;Double&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">Number of IP addresses that the appliance must generate and assign to the virtual server. The virtual server then functions as a network virtual server, accepting traffic on any of the generated IP addresses. The IP addresses are generated automatically, as follows: <br/>* For a range of n, the last octet of the address specified by the IP Address parameter increments n-1 times. <br/>* If the last octet exceeds 255, it rolls over to 0 and the third octet increments by 1.<br/>Note: The Range parameter assigns multiple IP addresses to one virtual server. To generate an array of virtual servers, each of which owns only one IP address, use brackets in the IP Address and Name parameters to specify the range.

The server ID is the hexadecimal representation of the IP address and port of the service to which the request must be forwarded.

Response times are learned through monitoring probes. This method also takes the number of active connections into account.<br/>Also available are a number of hashing methods, in which the appliance extracts a predetermined portion of the request, creates a hash of the portion, and then checks whether any previous requests had the same hash value. If it finds a match, it forwards the request to the service that served those previous requests. Following are the hashing methods: <br/>* URLHASH - Create a hash of the request URL (or part of the URL).<br/>* DOMAINHASH - Create a hash of the domain name in the request (or part of the domain name). The domain name is taken from either the URL or the Host header. If the domain name appears in both locations, the URL is preferred. If the request does not contain a domain name, the load balancing method defaults to LEASTCONNECTION.<br/>* DESTINATIONIPHASH - Create a hash of the destination IP address in the IP header. <br/>* SOURCEIPHASH - Create a hash of the source IP address in the IP header.  <br/>* TOKEN - Extract a token from the request, create a hash of the token, and then select the service to which any previous requests with the same token hash value were sent. <br/>* SRCIPDESTIPHASH - Create a hash of the string obtained by concatenating the source IP address and destination IP address in the IP header.  <br/>* SRCIPSRCPORTHASH - Create a hash of the source IP address and source port in the IP header.  <br/>* CALLIDHASH - Create a hash of the SIP Call-ID header.<br/>Default value: LEASTCONNECTION<br/>Possible values = ROUNDROBIN, LEASTCONNECTION, LEASTRESPONSETIME, URLHASH, DOMAINHASH, DESTINATIONIPHASH, SOURCEIPHASH, SRCIPDESTIPHASH, LEASTBANDWIDTH, LEASTPACKETS, TOKEN, SRCIPSRCPORTHASH, LRTM, CALLIDHASH, CUSTOMLOAD, LEASTREQUEST, AUDITLOGHASH, STATICPROXIMITY</p><p class="property_name">hashlength<span class="property_type">&lt;Double&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">Number of bytes to consider for the hash value used in the URLHASH and DOMAINHASH load balancing methods.<br/>Default value: 80<br/>Minimum value =  1<br/>Maximum value =  4096</p><p class="property_name">netmask<span class="property_type">&lt;String&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">IPv4 subnet mask to apply to the destination IP address or source IP address when the load balancing method is DESTINATIONIPHASH or SOURCEIPHASH.<br/>Minimum length =  1</p><p class="property_name">v6netmasklen<span class="property_type">&lt;Double&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">Number of bits to consider in an IPv6 destination or source IP address, for creating the hash that is required by the DESTINATIONIPHASH and SOURCEIPHASH load balancing methods.<br/>Default value: 128<br/>Minimum value =  1<br/>Maximum value =  128</p><p class="property_name">backuplbmethod<span class="property_type">&lt;String&gt;</span></p><p class="property_description">Backup load balancing method.
